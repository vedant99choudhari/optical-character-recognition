# optical-character-recognition
The program uses one-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks to recognize hand-written digits. The neural network input contains 5000 training examples of handwritten digits. each training example is a 20 X 20 pixel grayscale image of the digit. The neural network uses back propagation algorithm to train the neural network.
